# Digital Nomad Life in Bali: 3 Months In

Three months into my Bali adventure, and I'm still amazed by how this island balances productivity with paradise.

## The Good

- **Coworking Scene**: Dojo Bali and Outpost are incredible
- **Internet**: Surprisingly reliable 50+ Mbps in most areas
- **Community**: Amazing nomad community, especially in Canggu
- **Cost**: $800-1200/month for a comfortable lifestyle

## The Challenges

- **Rainy Season**: Coding during tropical storms is... interesting
- **Traffic**: Scooter rides to meetings can be adventures
- **Time Zones**: Client calls at 2 AM are rough

## Productivity Tips

1. **Morning Routine**: Surf at sunrise, code by 9 AM
2. **Coworking**: Don't work from your villa all the time
3. **Backup Internet**: Always have a mobile hotspot ready

The blend of tech work and tropical living is addictive. Already planning my next destination!
