# Essential Remote Work Tools for Developers in 2024

After working remotely from 15+ countries, here are the tools that keep me productive anywhere.

## Communication & Collaboration

- **Slack/Discord**: Team communication
- **Zoom/Meet**: Video calls with good mobile data usage
- **Notion**: Documentation and project management
- **Figma**: Design collaboration

## Development Environment

- **VS Code**: With Settings Sync enabled
- **GitHub Codespaces**: When local setup isn't possible
- **Docker**: Consistent environments everywhere
- **Tailscale**: Secure access to home lab

## Connectivity & Backup

- **Speedtest CLI**: `speedtest-cli` for quick connection checks
- **Multiple ISPs**: Always have 2+ internet sources
- **VPN**: Essential for accessing geo-restricted services
- **Power Bank**: 20,000mAh minimum for long coding sessions

## Productivity Hacks

```bash
# My daily setup script
#!/bin/bash
speedtest-cli
git status
docker-compose up -d
code .
```

## Location-Specific Tips

- **Thailand**: AIS has the best coverage
- **Indonesia**: Telkomsel for reliability
- **Portugal**: MEO fiber is excellent

The key is redundancy - always have backups for your backups!
